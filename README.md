# AutoLEDController
Autonomic LED controlling device which choose power of LED's,. according to luminous intensity reading from APDS9301 sensor, by previous choosen data by user [data.csv represents my light preferences(left column is luminous intensity, right column is LED power)]. I used scipy.optimize and curve_fit for calculating a poly function of my led preferences according to luminous intensity. All python code run on raspberry pi or other device, which can be used as TCP server. Circuit of LED controller i was modeling on: https://botland.com.pl/img/art/inne/CMS131_schemat.jpg
